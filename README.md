# subforth
A simple interpreter that supports a subset of forth.
<pre>
Work in progress.

Supports the following words:

+  -  *  /  PUSH  POP  DUP  DROP  BYE  HALT  WORDS  DEBUG
DEBUGOFF  PRINTPROG  DUMPSYM  SWAP  CR  CLEAR  MOD  =  >  <  SEE  VARIABLE
!  @  IF  <>  ELSE  DO  NEGATE  I  ?  INCLUDE  ROT  OVER
NIP  TUCK  EXIT  SYSTEM

Words can be extended by using the INCLUDE word. Example:  include functions.txt or include "functions.txt"
User defined words or functions are denoted with a (U): when you list the word dictionary.
 (U):SQUARE  (U):DOUBLE  (U):INC  (U):DEC
 
The interpreter supports Debugging within the Command Line. DEBUG turns full debugging on. DEBUGOFF turns it off. 
To debug a subsystem set the variable DEBUG_LAYER to desired level and re compile.

Added the system command to allow execution of other programs.

You can run the interprer interactively or pass a file as argument to run as a script.

./subforth -h
Use: ./subforth <FORTH_FILENAME.f>



Here is a simple test drive output:
